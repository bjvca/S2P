Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Raising agricultural productivity among smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan
 Africa is widely recognized as an important component of inclusive wealth
 creation and structural transformation.
 Central to this endeavor will be the adoption of sustainable soil and land
 management to improve the sustainability, resilience and productivity of
 agriculture.
 The USAID Bureau for Resilience and Food Security (RFS) has led a partnership
 with the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) and other partners
 to build a low-cost

Space to Place
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (S2P) approach for developing and disseminating localized fertilizer guidance.
 The S2P approach revolves around the delivery of spatially appropriate
 soil fertility management recommendations, guided by digitized soil maps
 (Space) combined with farm(er)-level characteristics (Place), for effective
 agronomic and fertilizer recommendations that increase fertilizer use efficienc
y to maintain or surpass current productivity levels, and reduce fertilizer
 wastage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IFPRI was tasked in 2023 to do a rigorous impact evaluation of the S2P approach.
 However, at the start of the project if quickly became clear that the S2P
 application was not going to be ready in the first operational year of
 the evaluation (during the 2024/25 growing season).
 A full and rigorous evaluation of the S2P approach was therefore deferred
 to the 2025/26 growing seasons and beyond.
 As such, we decided that the 2024/25 growing season could be used to generate
 learning to inform S2P

\begin_layout Section
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Governments in developing countries are trying to increase adoption of Green
 Revolution technologies, seed of improved varieties and mineral fertilizer
 in particular, through agricultural extension advice.
 In general, these extension systems provide blanket recommendations.
 One important reason why farmers fail to adopt seemingly profitable yield
 improving technologies is heterogeneity in the farmer's ability and context.
 For instance, high transacting costs may make a technology unprofitable
 for a farmer even though on average the technology would be profitable
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "suri2011selection"

\end_inset

.
 A similar argument can be made for soilâ€”another key production factor in
 agricultural production 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "arouna2021one"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Also here, differences in soil composition and nutrient content may mean
 that blanket fertilizer recommendations are sub-optimal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) provide an opportunity
 to deliver advisory services that are more tailored to the specific needs
 of farmers

.
 Numerous Site Specific Nutrient Management (SSNM) Decision Support Tools
 (DST) have been developed with the promise to reduce inefficiencies coming
 from grossly simplified recommendations, thereby raising the productivity
 and profitability from adopting improved inputs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "arouna2021one"

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, decision support tools for tailored nutrient recommendations have
 generally fallen short of expectations.
 This is illustrated by the numerous apps and tools that are out there but
 fail to scale 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sida2023failure"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Some of the reasons why such tools do not have more impact may be related
 to the following open questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the issue of spatial resolution, or how site specific these tools really
 are.
 Many of the tools rely on models that predict soil composition and nutrients
 in fairly large areas.
 As such, it has been argued that, often, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Itemize
the tools often focus too much on in-field heterogeneity, but not socioeconomic
 heterogeneity of users 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sida2023failure"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is partly due to the fact that these tools are developed by agronomists
 who maximize yields.
 However, farmers typically base decisions on cost-benefit considerations.
 In these considerations, a variety of other factors in addition to soil
 characteristics enter the equation.
 For instance, profitability is influence by availability and prices of
 the recommended fertilizers and the price at which farmers can sell the
 crops derived from the fields on which they invested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
related, the tools and apps we reviewed were mostly focusing on inorganic
 fertilizers.
 However, experts in the field were mostly talking about soil health.
 They argue that gains from using or re-optimizing inorganic fertilizer
 would be much smaller than what is typically found in on-station trials
 if we consider plots that suffer from years of nutrient mining and soil
 erosion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
decision support tools often take a host of pre-conditions for granted,
 the most critical probably being the fact that the recommended blend of
 soil macro- and micro nutrients is available to the farmer at reasonable
 cost.
 Indeed, as we will see below, most RCTs that study the effectiveness of
 DSTs have at least one treatment arm that investigates the importance of
 a particular pre-condition (such as access to insurance, financial resources,
 or information).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Space2Place approach addresses some of these concerns by combining SPACE
 (top-down information) and PLACE (on-site information) in a singe decision
 support tool to develop practical, profitable, scale-appropriate fertilizer
 and land management recommendations.

 is one of the few studies that has a treatment arm with a soil test (which
 is similar to one of the treatment arms in our study, see below).
 In particular, using rice farmers in Bangladesh as a case, they compare
 two types of site-specific fertilizer recommendationsâ€”community-level recommend
ations and plot-specific recommendations based on individual soil testsâ€”and
 compare this to government provided recommendations.
 They find limited effects, except perhaps for a reduction in application
 error (difference between recommended quantity of a particular nutrient
 and quantity used).
 That is, some farmers were using more than the recommended TSP and as a
 result of the intervention cut back.
 Some even appear to over-react and stop using TSP altogether, leading to
 lower yield.
 They also find indications that farmers adapt seed use to match baseline
 fertilizer use.
 Another study with a soil test treatment are is

 evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile application that provides personalized
 advice on rice nutrient management in Nigeria.
 In particular, they evaluate RiceAdvice, an Android-based application to
 provide personalized recommendations on nutrient management (type, quantity,
 and timing of fertilizer) in rice production.
 They find that the intervention increases yields by 7 percent.
 No soil tests are done.
 They also have a treatment that combines personalized advice with a grant
 that provides the recommended level of fertilizer.
 Here they estimate a treatment effect of 20 percent.
 They also found a 10% increase from the intervention on profit which increased
 to 23% when the intervention is combined with the grant.
 The mechanism behind the increase in yield and profitability seems to be
 a reallocation in the fertilizer mix, with farmers using less NPK and more
 Urea.

 profits from maize production, and household welfare using a cluster randomized
 control trial.
 They also have a treatment arm that adds insurance to the recommendation.
 They find significant reduction of the application error, which in turn

 In particular, they report a 13 percent increase in yield (437 on baseline
 yield of 3250 kg/ha) and a very similar increase in farmer profit.

Our research aims to look at a prototype S2P intervention, as well as assess
 the relative importance of two of the key components.
 It will also investigate the role of resources constraints as a potential
 enabling factor and look into peer learning.
 In particular, we will answer the following research questions:
\end_layout

 a soil test and the recommendation of a specific fertilizer blend based
 on this information change outcomes of interest? The motivation for this

 It tests if providing objectively measured scientific information provided
 in a fairly top-down fashion suffices to instigate behavior change.
 This research question also touches on the discussion whether information
 that allows farmers to optimize yields is useful to them.

Treatment Protocols 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer the 5 research questions above, we develop 5 different treatments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Treatment 1 (T1): In a first treatment, a farmer receives a soil report
 (see example in Appendix 1) derived from a soil test on a plot chosen by
 the farmer (See section

 for more information on the soil tests) , with some key characteristics
 of the soil.
 The report indicates the soil
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

s texture, pH level, cation exchange capacity, percentage organic matter,
 total nitrogen, carbon to nitrogen ratio, as well as the parts per million
 of available P, exchangeable K, calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, boron,
 copper and zinc.
 Beyond the exact measurements each soil property is given a score on a
 4-point Likert scale (very low, low, high, very high), with emojis, color
 coding and bar charts indicating where the soil is deficient and where
 the levels are sound.
 Using a script, a trained enumerator and/or extension worker then discusses
 the soil report with the farmer to derive a recommended nutrient package
 specific to the crop the farmer wants to grow.
 The farmer is then informed where and how to obtain these nutrients (in
 the form of a particular fertilizer blend).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Treatment 2 (T2): using a simple application (fertilizer optimizer), data
 is collected on inorganic fertilizer application that the farmer is planning
 to use in the upcoming season.
 It asks at what prices the farmer can obtain these fertilizers, and what
 the farmer plans to spend in total on fertilizers.
 It also allows one to input soil nutrient management practices that the
 farmer will use and has used in the past.
 This information is then used to come up with tailor-made suggestions on
 how the farmer can optimize fertilizer use.
 The philosophy behind this treatment is on the economics behind decision
 making related to inorganic fertilizer use.
 More information on the fertilizer optimizer app can be found in

Power calculations require the choice of an outcome variable.
 Normally, this outcome is assumed to be normally distributed, with a particular

 However, when simulation is used, it is possible to draw from an actual

 The outcome we consider in this study for our power calculations is maize
 yield.
 As such, we draw random samples from farmer level data that was collected

 report on more than 60 on site trials in SSA.
 Yield gains of rice and maize with SSNM in SSA were on average 24% and
 69% when compared to the farmer practice, respectively, or 11% and 4% when
 compared to local blanket fertilizer recommendations.

\begin_layout Standard
Based on this, for T1 and T2, we will consider similar effectsâ€”a 7 percent
 increase in yield.
 For T3, we model a 21 percent increase.
 While this may seem like a large effect, it should be noted that this effect
 includes the main effects of both treatments (two times 10 percentage points)
 as well as an interaction effect of 5 percentage points.
 Finally, for T4, we model a 40 percent treatment effect over the mean.
 However, as this is implemented as an additional treatment to T3, we will
 be interested in the difference between T3 and T4, which is a 15 percentage
 point difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We optimize power subject to the following constraints.
 As T1 and T2 are essentially interchangeable, we constrain the sample size
 in T1 and T2 to be the same.
 Furthermore, we place the same number of observations in the (pure) T3
 group as in the T4 group.
 In other words, of all farmers that get the complete S2P (T3) treatment,
 exactly half will also get the voucher (T4).

 shows power curves (statistical power reached with increasing sample size)
 for the different comparisons.
 Not surprisingly, the difference between the control group and T3 is easiest
 to identify given the large assumed treatment effect.
 We also have sufficient power to identify the additional effect of T4.
 This is different when we look at the power to detect a 7 percentage point
 increase from T1 (or T2 as we treat then symmetrically).
 The black line looks at combined treatments and shows the power for detecting
 a significant impact on at least one of T1 and T2 (in addition to identifying
 T3 and T4)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At about 1,850 observations, we have will detect a significant difference
 for all treatments 80 percent of the time.
 The allocation over the different treatment groups is as follows: T1 and
 T2 are each allocated 481 households.
 240 households receive T3, of which half (120) also receive T4.
 Finally, 648 households are in the control group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interventions are implemented at the individual level.
 While this maximizes power, the downside is that spillovers are more likely
 than some kind of clustered treatment assignment.

We will also test for balance on ten pre-specified variables.
 While we will not do a dedicated baseline, we will collect data on some
 background characteristics at the time of the treatment administration.
 We will use the following five variables that are unlikely to be affected
 by the treatments: farmer's age (in years), sex of farmer, household size,
 land area for crop production (acres), and AIP recepient in previous year.
 We also include five variables from among the outcomes of interest to test
 balance at baseline, in particular: use of organic fertilizer (yes/no),
 use of Urea (kg), yield, profit, crop in previous season was legume

We took the four districts that are known for maize production (Kasungu,
 Ntchisi, Dowa, and Mchinji).
 To get a nationally representative sampling frame of the smallholder farmer
 population in Malawi, we rely on the list created by the Ministry of Agricultur
e for their Agricultural Input Programme (AIP).
 The AIP targets smallholder farmers in the villages who mostly registered
 with the village chiefs.
 We used a two-stage sampling procedure where we first sampled villages
 with the likelihood of a village being selected proportionate to the number
 of people that live in this village (such that larger villages are more
 likely to end up in the sample).
 We cluster at village level and selected 30 households per village, resulting
 in about 65 villages.
 We block at the village level so we have: 10 control households, 8 T1 household
s, 8 T2 households, 2 T3 households and 2 T4 households.
 Code used to generate the sampling lists can be found

In all households, soil tests will be done.
 For this, we cooperate with Meridian's Farmer Support Unit (FSU).
 This private-sector player offers farmers spectral soil tests and site-
 and crop-specific recommendations.
 The model underlying the test was calibrated on wet-chemistry analyses
 conducted on 22,000 samples from across Malawi and has been rolled out
 across X years, now reaching Y farmers.
 The tool is part of a private-sector business model in which FSU Meridian
 forms a recommendation for a package of nutrients, which is then supplied
 through their network of 400 agrodealers.

Timeline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soil tests will be done in September 2024.
 Treatment administration (+ baseline data collection) will happen once
 results from the soil tests are available, which should be after about
 2 weeks.
 In April 2025, endline data will be collected.
