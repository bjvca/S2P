Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Raising agricultural productivity among smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan
 Africa is widely recognized as an important component of inclusive wealth
 creation and structural transformation.
 Central to this endeavor will be the adoption of sustainable soil and land
 management to improve the sustainability, resilience and productivity of
 agriculture.
 The USAID Bureau for Resilience and Food Security (RFS) has led a partnership
 with the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) and other partners
 to build a low-cost

Space to Place
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (S2P) approach for developing and disseminating localized fertilizer guidance.
 The S2P approach revolves around the delivery of spatially appropriate
 soil fertility management recommendations, guided by digitized soil maps
 (Space) combined with farm(er)-level characteristics (Place), for effective
 agronomic and fertilizer recommendations that increase fertilizer use efficienc
y to maintain or surpass current productivity levels, and reduce fertilizer
 wastage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IFPRI was tasked in 2023 to do a rigorous impact evaluation of the S2P approach.
 However, at the start of the project if quickly became clear that the S2P
 application was not going to be ready in the first operational year of
 the evaluation (during the 2024/25 growing season).
 A full and rigorous evaluation of the S2P approach was therefore deferred
 to the 2025/26 growing seasons and beyond.
 As such, we decided that  the 2024/25 growing season would be used to generate
 learning to inform S2P

\begin_layout Section
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Governments in developing countries are trying to increase adoption of Green
 Revolution technologies, seed of improved varieties and mineral fertilizer
 in particular, through agricultural extension advice.
 In general, these extension systems provide blanket recommendations.
 One important reason why farmers fail to adopt a seemingly profitable yield
 improving technologies is heterogeneity in the farmer's ability and context.
 For instance, high transacting costs may make a technology unprofitable
 for a farmer even though on average the technology would be profitable
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "suri2011selection"

\end_inset

.
 A similar argument can be made for the soil that the farmer worksâ€”another
 key production factor in agricultural production 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "arouna2021one"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Also here, differences in soil composition and nutrient content may mean
 that blanket fertilizer recommendations are sub-optimal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) may provide an opportunity
 to provide advisory services that are more tailored to the specific needs
 of farmers

 Numerous Site Specific Fertilizer Recommendation Decision support tools
 have been developed with the promise to reduce inefficiencies coming from
 grossly simplified recommendations, thereby raising the productivity and
 profitability from adopting improved inputs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "arouna2021one"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, decision support tools for tailored nutrient recommendations have
 generally fallen short of expectations, and this is illustrated by the
 numerous apps and tools that are out there but fail to scale 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sida2023failure"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Some of the reasons why such tools do not have more impact may be related
 to the following open questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the issue of spatial resolution, or how site specific these tools really
 are.
 Many of the tools rely on models that predict soil composition in large
 areas.
 As such, it has been argued that, often,

\begin_layout Itemize
the tools often focus too much on in-field heterogeneity, but not socioeconomic
 heterogeneity of users 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sida2023failure"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is partly due to the fact that these tools are developed by agronomists
 who maximize yields.
 However, farmers typically base decisions on cost-benefit considerations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
related, the tools and apps we reviewed were mostly focusing on inorganic
 fertilizers.
 However, experts in the field were mostly talking about soil health.
 They argue that gains from using or re-optimizing inorganic fertilizer
 would be much smaller than what is typically found in on-station trials
 if we consider plots that suffer from years of nutrient mining and soil
 erosion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
decision support tools often take a host of pre-conditions for granted,
 the most critical probably being the fact that the recommended blend of
 soil macro- and micro nutrients is available to the farmer at reasonable
 cost.
 Indeed, as we will see below, most RCTs that study the effectiveness of
 DSTs have at least one treatment arm that investigates the importance of
 a particular pre-condition (such as access to insurance, finance or information
)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Space2Place approach addresses some of these concerns by combining SPACE
 (top-down information) and PLACE (on-site information) in a singe decision
 support tool to develop practical, profitable, scale-appropriate fertilizer
 and land management recommendations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In light of this, we feel it is important to study the relative importance
 of the Space and Place components in a clean field experiment.

 is the only few study that has a treatment arm with a soil test (which
 is similar to one of our tretament arms, see below).
 In particular, they compare two types of variety-specific fertilizer recommenda
tions â€“ government provided, community-level recommendations and plot-specific
 recommendations based on individual soil tests among rice farmers in Bangladesh.
 They find limited effects, except perhaps for a reduction in application
 error (difference between recommended quantity of a particular nutrient
 and quantity used).
 That is, some farmers were using more than the recommended TSP and as a
 result of the interention cut back.
 Some even appear to over-react and stop using TSP altoghether, leading
 to lower yield.
 They also find indications that farmers adapt seed use to match baseline
 fertilizer use.

b instructions to guide the timing and quantity of urea (nitrogen) application.
 This intervention with substantially lower mental and attention demands
 on farmers does have a significant effect on the quantity of urea (nitrogen-fer
tilizer) applied.
 Taken together, this led them to conclude that advice should be bundled
 with training and extension services to ensure farmers benefit as intended.

 evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile application that provides personalized
 advice on rice nutrient management in Nigeria.
 In particular, they evaluate RiceAdvice, an Android-based application to
 provide personalized recommendations on nutrient management (type, quantity,
 and timing of fertilizer) in rice production.They find that the intervention
 increases yields by 7 percent.
 No soil tests are done.
 They also have a treatment that combines personalized advice with a grant
 that provides the recommended level of fertilizer.
 Here they estimate a treatment effect of 20 percent.
 They found a 10% increase from the intervention on profit which increased
 to 23% when the intervention is combined with the grant.
 The mechanism behind the increase in yield and profitability seems to be
 a reallocation in the fertilizer mix, with farmers using less NPK and more
 Urea.

Our research aims to look at a prototype S2P intervention, as well as assess
 the relative importance of two of the key components.
 It will also investigate the role of resources constraints as a potential
 enabling factor.
 In particular, we look at the following research questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does the provision of site-specific soil nutrient information and the recommenda

 of interest.
 The motivation for this research question can be found in the

 management change outcomes of interest.
 This research question focuses on potential interactions between the Space

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does the provision of site-specific nutrient recommendations and agronomic
 information with respect to soil nutrient management, combined with a subsidy
 to buy these nutrients at a local agro-dealer change the outcomes of interest.
 This research question looks at the importance of cash/credit constraints
 in the effectiveness of S2P.

\begin_layout Standard
The study area requires on the one hand the presence of Meridian

 run the voucher scheme through), but on the other hand a population that

 We intend to work with FSU to identify greenfield locations, where FSU
 is currently not operational, but where it is considering expansion by
 setting up new agro-dealerships.
 We would then work with FSU to adapt their approach in these areas for
 2024/25 season only.
 Within the market shed of the new shop, we will select X villages and compile
 a list all farmers with at least 0.4 ha of land.
 From this list we will randomly assign farmers into the 5 different treatment
 groups.

AIP recipients 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are expecting about one out of every four farmers in our sample to be
 receiving an AIP subsidy for the purchase of 50kg of the standard NPK blend
 and 50kg of Urea.
 The prevalence of AIP recipients will be balanced across treatment and
 control (that is, we will block on being an AIP recipient in some way).
 This will also allow us to look at treatment heterogeneity of the intervention
 on this attribute (impact of interventions among AIP recipient versus impact
 of interventions among non-AIP recipient) - see next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Impact heterogeneity 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will study heterogeneity across gender, land size, wealth, remoteness,
 availability of labor in the household, receipt of an AIP subsidy, and
 use of improved agricultural technology (irrigation, improved seeds, soil
 health management,â€¦).

Treatment Protocols 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Treatment 1 (T1): In a first treatment, a maize farmer is offered a free
 soil test on their main plot.
 If they accept, a few days later the farmer receives a soil report (see
 example in Appendix 1), with some key characteristics of the soil.
 The report indicates the soil
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

s texture, pH level, cation exchange capacity, percentage organic matter,
 total nitrogen, carbon to nitrogen ratio, as well as the parts per million
 of available P, exchangeable K, calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, boron,
 copper and zinc.
 Beyond the exact measurements each soil property is given a score on a
 4-point Likert scale (very low, low, high, very high), with emojis, color
 coding and bar charts indicating where the soil is deficient and where
 the levels are sound.
 Using a script, an enumerator then discusses the soil report with the farmer
 to derive a recommended nutrient package specific to the crop the farmer
 wants to grow.
 The farmer is then informed where and how to obtain these nutrients.
 The philosophy behind this treatment is really to provide objective information
 about the soil on the plot that was chosen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
For this treatment, we cooperate with Meridian's Farmer Support Unit (FSU).
 This private-sector player offers farmers spectral soil tests and site-
 and crop-specific recommendations.
 The model underlying the test was calibrated on wet-chemistry analyses
 conducted on 22,000 samples from across Malawi and has been rolled out
 across X years, now reaching Y farmers.
 The tool is part of a private-sector business model in which FSU Meridian
 forms a recommendation for a package of nutrients, which is then supplied
 through their network of 400 agrodealers.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Treatment 2 (T2): using a simple application (fertilizer optimizer), data
 is collected on inorganic fertilizer application that the farmer is planning
 to use in the upcoming season.
 It asks at what prices the farmer can obtain these fertilizers, and what
 the farmer plans to spend in total on fertilizers.
 It also allows one to input soil nutrient management practices that the
 farmer will use and has used in the past.
 This information is then used to come up with tailor-made suggestions on
 how the farmer can optimize fertilizer use.
 The philosophy behind this treatment is on the economics behind decision
 making related to inorganic fertilizer use.

 who test different approaches in field trials for barley production in
 Alaje, northern Ethiopia.
 They have a design with 4 treatment arms.
 The first is based on the Quantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical
 Soils (QUEFTS) model with yields up to 4,747 kg/ha.
 The second is a blended fertilizer application (which has an average yield
 of 4,045 kg/ha); the third treatment arm implements average farmers

 fertilizer application practices (where yield was 3,637 kg/ha) and there
 also a control group (without any fertilizer, obtaining 2,727 kg/ha).
 Form this, we learn that treatment effects range from 11 percent (if all
 farmers are using following farmer practices) up to 50 percent (if farmers
 were not using fertilizer before).

 report on more than 60 on site trials in SSA.
 Yield gains of rice and maize with SSNM in SSA were on average 24% and
 69% when compared to the farmer practice, respectively, or 11% and 4% when
 compared to local blanket fertilizer recommendations.

\begin_layout Standard
Based on this, for T1 and T2, we will consider similar effectsâ€”a 7 percent
 increase in yield.
 For T3, we model a 21 percent increase.
 While this may seem like a large effect, it should be noted that this effect
 includes the main effects of both treatments (two times 10 percentage points)
 as well as an interaction effect of 5 percentage points.
 Finally, for T4, we model a 40 percent treatment effect over the mean.
 However, as this is implemented as an additional treatment to T3, we will
 be interested in the difference between T3 and T4, which is a 15 percentage
 point difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We optimize power subject to the following constraints.
 As T1 and T2 are essentially interchangeable, we constrain the sample size
 in T1 and T2 to be the same.
 Furthermore, we place the same number of observations in the (pure) T3
 group as in the T4 group.
 In other words, of all farmers that get the complete S2P (T3) treatment,
 exactly half will also get the voucher (T4).

 shows power curves (statistical power reached with increasing sample size)
 for the different comparisons.
 Not surprisingly, the difference between the control group and T3 is easiest
 to identify given the large assumed treatment effect.
 We also have sufficient power to identify the additional effect of T4.
 This is different when we look at the power to detect a 7 percentage point
 increase from T1 (or T2 as we treat then symmetrically).
 The black line looks at combined treatments and shows the power for detecting
 a significant impact on at least one of T1 and T2 (in addition to identifying
 T3 and T4)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At about 1,850 observations, we have will detect a significant difference
 for all treatments 80 percent of the time.
 The allocation over the different treatment groups is as follows: T1 and
 T2 are each allocated 481 households.
 240 households receive T3, of which half (120) also receive T4.
 Finally, 648 households are in the control group.

\begin_layout Standard
The interventions are implemented at the individual level.
 While this maximizes power, the downside is that spillovers are more likely
 than some kind of clustered treatment assignment.

We will also test for balance on ten pre-specified variables.
 While we will not do a dedicated baseline, we will collect data on some
 background characteristics at the time of the treatment administration.
 We will use the following five variables that are unlikely to be affected
 by the treatments: farmer's age (in years), sex of farmer, household size,
 land area for crop production (acres), and AIP recepient in previous year.
 We also include five variables from among the outcomes of interest to test
 balance at baseline, in particular: number of crops grown by the farmer,
 use of seed of an improved variety, yield in previous season on the main
 plot.

\begin_layout Section
Problems and consideration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first question is related to the agronomic or the effect size of a fairly
 light touch intervention.
 Throughout the scoping, we found it hard to get researchers to quote effects
 of provide us with yield response curves.
 The problem is confounded by the fact that yield effects are likely secondary
 to cost benefit considerations when farmers decide to use a particular
 blend of fertilizer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The numerous laboratory services and digital applications providing field-specif
ic recommendations appear to promise more accuracy than soil analysis can
 realistically deliver

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The site specificness of many of the applications also needs to be taken
 with a grain of salt.
 In most cases, the input for the decision support systems consists of things
 like farmer agro-management practices and soil characteristics as evaluated
 by the farmers using rudimentary characteristics (clay, sandy, silt, or
 loam soil type).
 The models behind the decision support systems are often also not very
 specific, focusing on broad agro-ecological zones or administrative boundaries
 like districts.
 However, there will be plenty of farmers that are on the periphery for
 which alternative recommendations will be more effective.
 This is a serious concern, as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "beg2024information"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find little correlation between recommendations based on union-councils
 and actual nutrient content on the plots within these union-councils.
 More could be done by exploiting the geo-location capabilities of digital
 decision support tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another problem is that some applications focus on maximizing yields and
 to not consider costs.
 However, optimal fertilizer application is likely to change with both input
 and output prices.
 Again, the extent to which this can be integrated into an application can
 vary.
 The CABI app for instance, does consider the cost of inputs when optimizing
 fertilizer allocation but farmers have to input the prices of the fertilizers.
 A better way would be to link the application to prices that get updated
 in real-time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Site specific recommendations are not very effective is farmers can not
 access the blends or components being recommended.
 This was a problem that was repeatedly mentioned when we discussed site
 specific recommendations during scoping.
 Here, in theory, the use of ICT may provide an excellent opportunity to
 link advise to stocks in real time.
 For instance, when recommendations are provided, the application may point
 farmers to the nearest agroworld shop that has the particular blend in
 stock.
 Alternatively, the decision support tool may resort to a second best blend
 if the first choice can not be obtained within a reasonable distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somewhat related, the total cost of the blend should also be considered.
 It was mentioned that farmers know the optimal blend, but that they will
 go for the cheaper option.
 This
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indivisibility, rule-of-thumb etc.
 Farmers just use what they get, regardless of how much land they have and
 what soil quality is.
 Or farmers do not pay attention to quantities.
 Do not say use 20kg of dap and 10 kg of urea, but use twice as much dap
 as urea.
 Again, the idea of some kind of market place for fertilizer would help...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first year, we will work with a paper based version of the decision
 support.
 We will have 4 different treatment arms in the form of a factorial design.
 In a first treatment cell, we will have site specific recommendations.
 In a second treatment, we will provide extension on fertilizer application
 using a principled approach.
 In a third treatment cell, we combine extension on fertilizer application
 with extension.
 A final treatment cell functions as a pure control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second year, the decision support tool will be piloted, but this
 time with an alternative

 in higher quantiles.

, who define this as follows: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For the treatment households, the fertilizer use gap is calculated by using
 the absolute difference between the actual macronutrient in kg/ha that
 farmers applied for maize production and the site-specific recommended
 values, whereas for the control households we used the absolute deviation
 of the actual macronutrients used by farmers and the regional recommendation
 values.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This could also be modeled as a quadratic loss function.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, the application error is constructed for farmers who apply a non-zero
 amount of the respective fertilizer and is the absolute difference between
 endline usage and the recommended quantity for each fertilizer (and it
 is not clear what recommended quantities they use).
 They standardize the application error with respect to the control group
 mean and standard deviation.
